A demo monorepo in Flutter, using melos.

In short, this repositories contains multiple apps that shared the same codebase and reusable components.

The idea can be generalized for various use cases.

then you can start bootstrap with:

 `$ melos bs`

 `$ melos run run:buyer`

 or 

 `$ melos run run:seller` 

To run style check on all repositories:
